  <h1>Product Agreement</h1>
  
  <div class="contract">
    <p>This Product Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the purchase, acceptance, and use of the electronic device (“Product”) by the purchaser (“Buyer”) from the seller (“Seller”). By typing your name and clicking the confirm button below, Buyer agrees to all terms set forth herein, regardless of length, complexity, or readability.</p>
    
    <p>1. The Product is sold as-is, without warranties beyond those required by law, and Buyer acknowledges that performance, condition, or satisfaction may vary.</p>
    
    <p>2. Buyer understands that this Agreement constitutes a one-time, final, non-refundable, and non-reversible transaction. No returns, exchanges, or chargebacks are permitted except as legally mandated.</p>
    
    <p>3. Buyer’s decision to acquire the Product is voluntary, informed, and entirely at Buyer’s discretion. Seller makes no representations beyond factual disclosure of the Product.</p>
    
    <p>4. Title, ownership, and all associated risk transfer immediately upon acceptance. Buyer assumes full responsibility for use, storage, maintenance, handling, and any consequences arising therefrom.</p>
    
    <p>5. Seller shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive, or speculative damages, including but not limited to financial loss, inconvenience, emotional distress, or reputational impact.</p>
    
    <p>6. Buyer irrevocably waives any rights to sue, arbitrate, dispute, initiate chargebacks, or claim damages of any kind. Encouraging third parties to assert claims on Buyer’s behalf is equally waived.</p>
    
    <p>7. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Texas, and all disputes shall be resolved exclusively in courts located therein. Buyer consents to jurisdiction and venue accordingly.</p>
    
    <p>8. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, invalid, or illegal, the remaining provisions shall remain fully effective and enforceable.</p>
    
    <p>9. This Agreement represents the entire understanding between Buyer and Seller and supersedes all prior communications, representations, or agreements, oral or written, relating to the Product.</p>
    
    <p>10. Acceptance is confirmed by typing your full name and clicking the confirm button. This constitutes a binding electronic signature, equivalent to a handwritten signature for all purposes.</p>
    
    <p>11. Definitions: “Acceptance” refers to Buyer’s act of typing their name and clicking confirm; “Product” refers to the electronic device; “Seller” refers to the entity providing the Product; “Buyer” refers to the person accepting the Product.</p>
    
    <p>12. Supplemental Clauses: This Agreement contains additional sub-clauses, disclaimers, indemnifications, intellectual property notices, headings, definitions, corporate legal language, and references to standard contractual terms, all of which are incorporated by reference and intended to create a dense, lengthy, and comprehensive legal document.</p>
    
    <p>13. Acknowledgment: Buyer acknowledges that this Agreement is extensive, verbose, and may appear tedious, repetitive, or overwhelming. Continued scrolling, typing the name, and clicking confirm constitutes full ratification of all terms.</p>
    
    <p>14. Notices: Any notices required by law may be delivered electronically or physically, and electronic copies of this Agreement shall have the same effect as original copies.</p>
    
    <p>15. Miscellaneous: Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. Waiver of one right shall not constitute waiver of any other. Electronic acceptance is legally binding, and this Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts.</p>
    
    <p>16. Force Majeure: Seller shall not be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from causes beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, or technological failures.</p>
    
    <p>17. Confidentiality: Buyer agrees to treat the contents of this Agreement as confidential, though enforcement is not sought, but the language herein contributes to overall legal structure and length.</p>
    
    <p>18. Indemnification: Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any claims, liabilities, losses, or expenses arising directly or indirectly from acceptance or use of the Product.</p>
    
    <p>19. Continuation: This Agreement may be continuously referenced, updated, or supplemented. Buyer acknowledges that the dense, repetitive, and verbose nature is intentional, to create maximum legal text volume and reader fatigue.</p>
    
    <p>20. Confirmation: Typing your full name below and clicking confirm constitutes full acceptance of this Agreement. By doing so, Buyer agrees to all foregoing terms, acknowledges reading difficulty, and confirms voluntary, informed, and legally binding consent.</p>
    
    <p>21. Repetition Clause: Any similar terms, disclaimers, and statements herein, whether previously stated or implied, are reiterated for emphasis, enforceability, and length. Buyer acknowledges redundancy does not reduce effect or enforceability.</p>
    
    <p>22. Extended Legal Boilerplate: This Agreement may include, without limitation, any standard contractual language, legal references, procedural references, clauses on intellectual property, liability, assignment, notice, governing law, venue, dispute resolution, enforcement, amendment, waiver, severability, electronic execution, signature equivalents, and any other legal constructs deemed standard or advisable.</p>
    
    <p>23. Scroll Disclaimer: Buyer is aware that scrolling through this Agreement may cause visual fatigue, boredom, or monotony. This is intentional and serves no purpose other than extending the textual length and replicating formal corporate documentation style.</p>
    
    <p>24. Binding Acceptance: By scrolling, typing, and confirming, Buyer legally binds themselves to all above clauses, sub-clauses, disclaimers, and supplementary legal constructs, creating a full, enforceable, and extensive legal contract.</p>
    
    <p>25. End of Document: No further acknowledgment is necessary beyond typing your full name and clicking confirm. Acceptance is fully binding and complete.</p>
